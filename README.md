=======

LDsynLikSpat.R contains the likelihood functions and simulation as written with the Laplace's Demon package

functions_migration.R contains all the interfacing between R and C for the gillespie and probability matrix generation

functions_migration.c contains all the c code for running multiple gillespies, for computing the statistics, and for computing the probability matrix

functions_sampling.R contains the sampling code written in R (to replace Laplace's Demon) REPLACEMENT BEING WORKED ON CURRENTLY

param.r contains the parameters being used for the gillespie simulations -> this file is an important file (it needs to be written in some better manner later)
